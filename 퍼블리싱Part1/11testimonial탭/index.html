                        As we all know, it’s easy for marketers to brag about how great their product or service is. Writing compelling copy, shooting enticing photos, or even producing glamorous videos are all tactics we use to draw attention to our brands. While all of these strategies can be successful, there really is no better way to gain trust and prove the validity of your brand like customer testimonials.
